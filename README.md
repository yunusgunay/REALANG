# REALANG

## 📚 Description
**Realang** is a newly designed programming language limited to real numbers (ℝ), developed as part of **CS 315 - Programming Languages** coursework of Bilkent University. It includes features inspired by imperative languages and consists of:
- 🔢 **Project 1:** Design and implementation of the language’s lexical analyzer using **Lex**.
- 🔢 **Project 2:** Design and implementation of a parser for the language using **Yacc**.

---

## 1️⃣ Project 1 - Lexical Analyzer
- 📌 Defined the language’s grammar using **BNF (Backus-Naur Form)**.
- 📌 Designed a **Lexical Analyzer** using **Lex** to scan source code and generate token sequences.
- 📌 Wrote example programs to demonstrate the language's functionality.

### 🎉 Grade: **99/100**

## 2️⃣ Project 2 - Parser Implementation
- 📌 Revised and extended the language’s grammar.
- 📌 Built a **Parser** using **Yacc** to validate and parse programs.
- 📌 Implemented error handling to detect syntax errors and print line numbers.
- 📌 Evaluated the parser with sample programs to ensure correctness.
